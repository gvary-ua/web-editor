# Web editor

Web editor is a Notion-like SPA. It is a block-based text editor which is fine-tuned for the authors.

Before executing npm commands set your Node to `lts/hydrogen`, or `v18.16.1`.

- `nvm use lts/hydrogen` - set Node version that we use
- `npm start` - start dev server
- `npm run build` - build optimized version
